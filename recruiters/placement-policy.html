                         T&amp;P cell will strictly follows the policy of allowing single candidate with single job/internship (i.e., One-Student-One-Job) irrespective of company status (private / PSU / Government / Education sector etc.) and CTC offered.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
                         The company must complete their selection process in a single day.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
                         The slot allotted by the placement office to the company is of 8 hours only. Although the companies are allowed to conduct test on the previous/same day to shortlist the candidates. The Start Time, End Time and Duration of Slot will be decided by the T&amp;P Cell depending upon the number of companies pooled.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
                         Interview process for any candidate must be completed by 8.00 PM on the same day and the result should be declared to T&amp;P Cell only (not to students) by 9.00 PM on the same day. The T&amp;P Cell will declare the results to the students before 11:00 PM.

                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
                         There is a high probability of multiple offers, the companies have to provide the waiting list at the end of the selection process so that when a candidate is selected in more than one company the wait listed candidate can be pushed for selection. The wait list will not be disclosed to the students and will be released on a per students basis.
                    </p>

                         The companies are required to be in touch with the SCPT and T&amp;P Officials at all time. They should not entertain any direct contact from the students appearing in the placement process. In case of such situation, the company must bring this immediately to the notice of the placement office.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
