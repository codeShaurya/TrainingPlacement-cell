                We are in the quest of international standards of excellence in all our endeavors and we aim at creating a complete personality in our students, professionally ,socially and morally. The residential campus helps us in achieving this goal by providing academic liberty to innovate and come out with novel ideas. I am sure that the industries will be benefited from these young and lively minds. The slow down that the industry faces today is only a temporary phenomenon and our economy is already reviving.

                Our placement office is well equipped with the facilities that are required for smooth conduct of recruitment activity and I am sure that our students will find it useful in securing the placement of their choice. I congratulate the placement office for their efforts and wish all the students the very best of luck in their chosen career path.
